Subject: [Preisshare-dev] New pricelist Generator
Message-ID: <459463E7.1080100@preisshare.net>

Hi all,

I've accidently added some people to the mailing list instead of 
inviting them. I simply pressed the wrong button. So if this stuff isn't 
interesting, it's time to unsubscribe. Which can easily be done on the 
link that should be below.

For the willing, we've got some new screens...

The first is to add people to the distribution list



And then a new pricelist generator selection screen. Once the clients 
are added, the generator will send out the new pricelists to them.




We plan to make a release by the end of january. Otherwise simply 
download the source and give compiling a go.

Best Regards

David
