Hi Steve,

Have you seen this page?

http://www.xmlpitstop.com/StyleSheetCentral/SSC_1TOM.aspx

They have some very interesting style sheets on there.

I'd like to be able to do more of this sort of stuff and include it  
within the software.

Let me know your thoughts...

Regards

David

Hi David

Yes, I believe it was Ken who originally put forward
the idea of 'push' and 'pull' in xslt. You tend to 'pull'
when you know the data and 'push' when you don't.
I used 'pull' because we are pretty sure of the data
but if the data is likely to evolve a lot and the order
of the data in particular might change we could
switch to 'push'. (Plus the tool I use uses it.)

Push - use templates/apply-templates
Pull - use for-each/value-of

Ken's book has a lot on this and he has/does a course
too (which SystML offers - plug, plug - http://www.systml.co.uk )
Ken's book is
G. Ken Holman: Definitive XSLT and XPath, Prentice Hall

Of course Mr Kay's books cover the same sorts of things
(M. Kay, Wrox) and there is the advantage they do XSLT 2 too.
I appreciate lots of fun using all these books a lot and
learning from these guys. Thanks Ken and Michael.

I must admit I find all this stuff very cool, though it can
be frustrating at times as it isn't a 'Turing complete'
language and also getting the hang of use of recursion
a lot can be challenging (but who doesn't love a challenge).

Now and then you need something else, such as when
messing with unknown namespaces.

All the best

Steve

Hi Steve,

so you're looking for a place to *do* cool. That's good :-)

It would be good to get a collection of different transformations and 
stylesheets relating to price updating together in one collection.

Sonmez and me have been trying to get the transformations happening in 
python. Ever used python?

Hi David

No, never used Python but I'm always having to
learn new languages and philosophies quickly.
I guess the XML bits of Python aren't much
different to other XML handling methods. Do you
use 4Suite for the XSLT?

But yes, I do relish any chance to *do* cool :-)

All the best

Steve

Hi Sonmez,

ok, here is a company.

Build an xml pricelist file.

Do whatever with python and send back.

Hi Steve,

Sorry to say this but I've had a complete change of direction.

Time has come to stop the beer talk about UBL and start moving on it.

So what I'm proposing is to include UBL in the production software that 
we issue out sometime this year. What I want to do is to make transforms 
that will produce UBL Quotes, Orders and Invoices and possibly 
pricelists/catalogues. from an xml version of these documents.

So what I'm saying, is that I need a UBL Quotation.xslt to transform (an 
xml version) of the below. I will then include that in the software that 
I'm selling.

Then, I'll consider making some sort of credible anouncement about it 
after it is done.

Regards

David

Hi David

Is the following any good as a PreisShare Quotation in XML and a
schema?

If these are OK I can start mapping them to the UBL Quotation

All the best

Hi Sonmez,

Here's an interesting link that I found on testing
windows applications from within a python script

Subject: [Preisshare-dev] Price feeds ... collecting data from websites

Hi All,

Ludwig suggested that we offer some sort of price feed. That is being  
able to pull down price files off websites and load them into the  
product database.

The idea is that if all suppliers can make a price file available then  
PreisShare can pull all the price files down and load them.

Well the concept is advancing. I recently did a test capture off a  
test machine and this is what it looks like.

Thanks DW.

You might find it interesting to know that the csv data actually gets 
'marked' up before it is loaded. So it shouldn't be so hard taking the 
feeds from xml (ubl/whatever). Hopefully we can do that sometime this 
year. There are a few companies that have xml data on their website, not 
many though.

It will be interesting what they say in HK and China when I visit there 
in a week or so. One silly sales girl in Taiwan told me "It's too 
complex for me, I don't understand it".

But that is just an invitation to explain the whole process better, 
which is price relaying. Quickly downloading all your price files every 
day, recalculating and re-issuing. All done with little in the way of 
manual effort.

I'm also starting to consider putting ebxml into the mix. Maybe it can 
add some value. Maybe we should look at doing some tests.

Regards

David
