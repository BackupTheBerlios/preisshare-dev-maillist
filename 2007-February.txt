It's a good high level idea....

We don't currently have a web based offering. It's all a windows  
client that does stuff directly at the moment.

A web based product is certainly on the list of things to do. We're  
trying to perfect the spreadsheet reading and the plan is to move that  
into being server based in the future. Sonmez is working on a  
multiplatform version so hopefully he might be able to look at that  
soon.

In the meantime, we spend a lot of time learning all the tricks of  
managing all these prices for products and companies coming out of  
asia. It is quite complex.

That is certainly keeping us busy for the moment...

Regards

David

Yes, I think every programming language offers it these days.

Yes, it is pretty routine.

We're just trying to get it organised, making it easier for smaller  
businesses to be able to use.

Import Mapper

We already do have such an import mapper built into the Search screen. 
It will do it's best to pick the product information out of an Excel sheet.

One problem that we have is that it needs Excel. But I'm trying to 
incorporate the flexcel product which would read files directly. This 
hopefully should improve performance and the dependance on windows and 
excel.

Regards

David

Hi David

In one sense these product groups could just be translated into
the UBL catalogue line description along with the product name.
That wouldn't work going from UBL to preisshare-xml though, so
I'll try to find something better, like category, and add it to
everything. No need to change the preisshare-xml though for that. 

What would you do with "*Both are kingston non-hynix retailed packed*"?
That might need a note but it would be a note on product group
which might not have an equivalent in UBL so it would be lost in translation
to UBL.

All the best

Steve

In our internal reader/writer class (in memory), we actually build a 
flat list of all items and include the product group name as another field.

Group_Description&="Kingston Memory" Name&="512mb/533" Actual_Price$=31.50
Group_Description&="Kingston Memory" Name&="1G/533" Actual_Price$=61.30

So when it comes to writing out an output file, all of the information 
is easy at hand and ready to write.

That's possible. When converting from spreadsheets it's always possible 
that minor pieces get lost. It's not always a lossless process.

Not sure what you mean by common accross a domain.. is a domain the 
price list file?

Reading out the product Groups usually takes little to no time.

Are you thinking of the lookup as being part of the sending or receiving 
process?

You'll have to contact the supplier directly. We don't supply any

At the moment we don't.

It might be something that we can look at the future to.

One of the reasons that I like the Asian style of things is that it is 
so free for all.

Having worked on similar projects here, if you insist on standardising 
product descriptions, you end up with bland goop.

For example, "Writing Instrument - BIC - Black Ink - 15cm transparent 
plastic shaft"

So somebody goes and types "black biro" into the search engine, and 
can't find anything. Useless....

My preference is that if the suppliers don't describe it right, then 
they don't sell it and it is their problem.

A few caveats on that.

<Product>
 PLU&="42343"
 Name&="Black Pen"
 Description&="* Transparent Shaft. * compatable with biro"
 Brand&="BIC"
 Model&="A50B"
</Product>


Seperating out the manufacturers model number and brand. They're important.

Regards

David

Yes, it's certainly simple and to the point.

That's why I was saying we should build something like that into PreisShare.

Note that their format is fixed - so they insist that the provider  
ensure that the format is prepared for them.

This is consistent with PreisShare, in which you can individually  
specify which columns go into the file.

Remember that job for the Insurance company that you did? That is  
exactly how they work. They have their own definition on what columns  
they expect and the file is transformed and uploaded to the website  
according to what they want.

Regards

David

Hi David/Stephen,

This is our now commercial Brochure that we'll be using for the year.

We going to be focusing on Import/Search/Relay...

A capability where we are able to redistribute price information quickly 
out to clients, along with a search engine.

So far, we've been getting quite a number of enquiries from Asia and it 
seems to be appropriate to the market that we are going for.

Regards

David

Hi Stephen,

You're added in. :-)

You sent me a zip file about two weeks ago. It was good. I'm not sure  
how many changes you have made since.

We can create a directory in berlios for the schemas.

If you want to just put whatever file you want me to edit on the email  
list I can turn changes around fairly quickly. I'm fairly flexible -  
but we'll eventually get it all organised.

I've found CVS doesn't really like changing directory names very much.  
So it's important to be pretty sure of what you are doing before you  
do it.

Regards

David

Hi Sonmez,

Luckily it Chinese New Year now, and those companies in Asia have  
stopped sending me pricelists for a few days. :-)

So I've finally got a chance to ask you to start building an app.

What I need you to start writing is an application in Lazarus using  
Overbyte.de mail components, to download emails from a mailbox.

This will be used for automated pricelist collection.

So are you right to start with this ?

It just needs to be a very simple app indeed with one form, a display  
box to show what is going on and the TPop3Cli component.

You can hardware all the fields to start with if this helps.

Regards

David

Hi David

This might sound odd but could you send me a copy of
that file back again and I can then see if it needs much
changing. It will need to be modified as the requirements
for further elements are ascertained of course. Being XML
that shouldn't break anything (if it's done right) but best
not to decide final details like namespace yet until it is
mature. We'd need to ensure it is seen as a draft with
a draft namespace until then. The other schema without
a namespace would be draft too and develop in parallel.

The directory structure will need a bit of thought, yes.

All the best

Steve

Hi Steve,

This weekend I'm doing an import run over a stack of pricelists from 
Asia that I've received over the last two weeks. There's quite a few. It 
took me 3 hours last night just cleaning them out of my email inbox.So I 
have some compassion for the amount of time that it takes people in the 
computer industry to manually process this stuff. It's just information 
overload to the max.

What I would like you to do is to start getting the XML documentation 
together as you've already started.

Then I'll send you over some of the sample data that I have.

You can check it.

At present, we can produce the data in XML but not load it in.

Hopefully during March we can get this done.

At the moment I'm pretty busy working on the Price Relay basics and 
tidying up the search Engine so that it can be demonstrated this week.

Regards

David

David,

I can understand why you might see the similarity but there is a lot 
more to PreisShare than just the XML messages.

Over time, the concepts have been refined to include things that 
businesses can actually use in day to day operation like the search engine.

Loading all the price information into a database and being able to 
search it is more what PreisShare is about rather than the electronic 
messages.

Regards

David

Hi David,

I was reading the article.. at the bottom I noticed references to XML 
Global and CatXML.org. Neither of these companies seem to be still 
around so I assume they kindof fell by the wayside.

Sometimes timing is everything.

One difficulty I guess was the premise that you could give a "really  
good format", by this I mean xml, to a programmer and they would do  
something incredible with it.

Unfortunately, it doesn't happen like this in the business world and  
it is actually getting much much worse.

Programming is being increasingly being offshored, and programmers are  
rarely given the budget to do anything really spectacular with pricing  
information.

My take is that there is just a glut of Excel price data out there  
that very few companies can deal with effectively.

Hence PreisShare and the product search.

All I can say is that it takes some time and a lot of work to really  
pry out of small businesses what they actually need in terms of  
pricing systems.

And yes, Google has taught us all a lesson about searching, and it's  
value. That's for sure.

David

Hi Mathias,

Let me know how you go with that xml file.

There is actually quite a lot of commercial opportunities out there when 
you know this stuff.

I had a think about the problem. One way might be to do a statistical 
count of all nodes that are found in the document.

And then, if there are a matching set of say 1400 productid nodes, 1400 
productname nodes, then that forms a set from which to work with.

Regards

David

Steve,

This is Davids original message. It contains a file 
"PreisShare-catalog-rules" which is really interesting.

I'd like to somehow get this cleaned up and used. It was a very good start.

Goes to show the depth of DRW's knowledge.

Next I need to figure out how to get cam running. I have to admit I'm 
scared of java and setting up classpaths. Oh well.

Regards

David

Ah yes, that should be fine.

Thanks David

Subject: [Preisshare-dev] Testing price relaying with CAM..
Message-ID: <20070222175058.n7lpgw8th874occ4@srv11.ezyreg.com>

Hi David,

I'm thinking over the next month or so to do some testing with price  
relaying and CAM.

I've now identified some good daily data feeds which I can build a relay from.

What I'm wondering is if you have a smtp mailbox that can pickup  
PreisShareXML and feed it into CAM for validation at your side.

The files would come as an attachment.

If you then had the software at your side, you could then relay the  
prices onto Steve. And so forth.

Let me know if you are interested in taking part. I think it would  
take about an hour per week over four weeks. It's an experimental  
thing but I don't believe that it will be too difficult to find  
customers once we can demo it in operation.

Regards

David

Steve/Dave,

The good thing about this file is that it is so simple that even I can 
understand it ! :-)

There are quite a few fields in the <Product> section that are missing. 
Mainly because I haven't told you about them. But I'm sure that they can 
be easily introduced a little later.

I would say that the next step is going to be somehow getting this up 
onto my website onto an 'xml' page.

So that somebody could have a look and see that the xml format is 
'really simple' and that they could even try to use it themself. This 
would be the desirable outcome.

The question then becomes, "ok - I have my pricelist in xml, how do I 
use CAM to validate it?"

Having the documentation for both a PreisShare command-line to generate 
the file and a CAM command-line to validate the file on the web page 
that they could run to tie it all together would be really nice. It 
would be something that would be safe enough to try at home.

So if you want to add a bit of documentation for running the CAM 
validator, feel free. It would be really useful.

Regards

David
