<PRE>Quoting &quot;David RR Webber \(XML\)&quot; &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/preisshare-dev">david at drrw.info</A>&gt;:

&gt;<i> Yep - this was a trip down memory lane here - deja vu.    The CatXML
</I>&gt;<i> idea certainly ahead of its time - and getting everyone back then to
</I>&gt;<i> see the value - before XML was even established.
</I>
Sometimes timing is everything.

One difficulty I guess was the premise that you could give a &quot;really  
good format&quot;, by this I mean xml, to a programmer and they would do  
something incredible with it.

Unfortunately, it doesn't happen like this in the business world and  
it is actually getting much much worse.

Programming is being increasingly being offshored, and programmers are  
rarely given the budget to do anything really spectacular with pricing  
information.

My take is that there is just a glut of Excel price data out there  
that very few companies can deal with effectively.

Hence PreisShare and the product search.

All I can say is that it takes some time and a lot of work to really  
pry out of small businesses what they actually need in terms of  
pricing systems.

And yes, Google has taught us all a lesson about searching, and it's  
value. That's for sure.

David
