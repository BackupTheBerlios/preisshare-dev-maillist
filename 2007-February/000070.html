Steve/Dave,

The good thing about this file is that it is so simple that even I can 
understand it ! :-)

There are quite a few fields in the &lt;Product&gt; section that are missing. 
Mainly because I haven't told you about them. But I'm sure that they can 
be easily introduced a little later.

I would say that the next step is going to be somehow getting this up 
onto my website onto an 'xml' page.

So that somebody could have a look and see that the xml format is 
'really simple' and that they could even try to use it themself. This 
would be the desirable outcome.

The question then becomes, &quot;ok - I have my pricelist in xml, how do I 
use CAM to validate it?&quot;

Having the documentation for both a PreisShare command-line to generate 
the file and a CAM command-line to validate the file on the web page 
that they could run to tie it all together would be really nice. It 
would be something that would be safe enough to try at home.

So if you want to add a bit of documentation for running the CAM 
validator, feel free. It would be really useful.

Regards

David

</I>&gt;<i> Now I wonder whether there is much more for me to

</I>&gt;<i> It would probably just need a model with the TBG17

</I>&gt;<i> existing BIEs and CCs and qualifying the datatypes.
</I>&gt;<i> That could be slowish work though but it might mean
</I>&gt;<i> feeding back stuff to TBG17 (like the pricelist
</I>&gt;<i> group element - CatalogueLine inside CatalogueLine?).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I could then just work on the UBL equivalent and the
</I>&gt;<i> halfway house of the 'Simpler than UBL' lookalike.
</I>&gt;<i> Plus stylesheets could be maintained for transforming
</I>&gt;<i> between these. I could do the STU for PreisShare and
</I>&gt;<i> the Catalogue (PriceList) for SystML and the two
</I>&gt;<i> would then complement eachother. There could be some
</I>&gt;<i> documenting for PreisShare and the transformations.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Does this sound OK?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> All the best
