Yes I believe that it would.

You can read the Access database directly with Python. I looked up a 
python database driver for ado and found the following link:

http://www.mayukhbose.com/python/ado/ado-connection.php

What would be good is some scripts that read the database once it has 
been updated, generate some fancy html pages for this and that, and so 
forth.

These things could include displaying new products, price changes etc. 
Doing it in python is not such a bad idea. Why not come up with some 
interesting concepts and we'll see how easy/hard they would be to do them.

Regards

David

Yeah,

That's kindof what I'm thinking.

Recently, I've been working with 3d, so once we get some, I can render 
them on a 3d moving object around the PreisShare workspace. But it is a 
little way off yet.

Reminds me I should be working on this seriously... :-)

David,

Have you come across shopinfo.xml ?

It's interesting... at the moment we're linking in to that system.

Here is a script that pulls down product information. If you don't have 
the time/will to run it, here is the output.

Certainly provides us with a lot of data...

F:\PreisShare\ShopInfo Utilities>perl pull_shopinfo.pl 19
Now pulling down http://www.asmedia.de/shopinfo.xml

Subject: [Preisshare-dev] Models Database
Message-ID: <46831437.4080808@preisshare.net>

Sonmez,

We need to add a models & brands table into the database.

I'm doing this in MS-Access here at the moment. That doesn't matter so 
much. Here is what the tables look like.

Can you setup an appropriate set of tables under mysql.

After that, we'll probably need a new script that will check models if 
they exist in this database. If they don't then they should be added.

Regards

David
