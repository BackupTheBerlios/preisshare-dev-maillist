Ludwig,

Yeah, there's lots.

I'm just building an automation component for pulling down the price  
files from websites.

It is an essential component to have in PreisShare. Maybe we can go  
talk to some of these places. Or introduce it as a feature to make it  
easier for the computer places to upload their product files.

Very interesting stuff.. I agree...

Sonmez,

These are the price files that we are receiving.

It would be good to be able to decode these in perl and write the
results to a preisshare file.

You will need the tableextract perl module.

It's a very interesting task.

Then we can relay the prices. This will give us another constant feed of
prices

It's a good idea of course.

Certainly would make it a lot easier.

Let me know when you have the blank spreadsheet.. :-) We can start to  
forward it to them and see how it goes.

Sinu,

Still a fair bit to go. The idea sounds simple but they take time to get 
right.

Here I'm just trying to get the full circle of price-relaying working. 
And make it very simple to use.

What I've ended up doing is using DWSII (Delphi web script) to do the 
actual price calculations. This means that the users can put in whatever 
logic that they like to calculate from the cost price up to the final 
sell price.

The Relay_Calculations.pas file sits in the PreisShare directory. It 
get's interpreted, not compiled into the program.

I've attached a sample.

An Editor (with syntax highlighting) is built into the new PriceSharer. 
c/o the SynEdit components.

We've got this running in production now and it seems to be ok.

So it will be nice to be able to download some prices from an email, run 
the relay_calculations over the prices, and then pump out new prices to 
customers. We're getting ever closer.

Regards

David

Hi Steve,

I know that you can't compile it because you don't have a development  
environment set up. But here is some code from tradedesk showing how  
the xpath(like) assignments work.

Would the aim be to convert this just enough to use the
XML format from DRRW? Not at this point UBL? If so it
doesn't look like a lot has to change in this code (just
add issue date, document ID, etc) but this abstracts the
underlying syntax: Is this move from custom format to XML
in hand?

Maybe then the conversion would to using DRRW's XML (the
same sort of semantics but with XML confomormance and
just a few amendments) and if it were a requirement to
import or export UBL, say (or any other formats) this
could be attempted using an XSLT or equivalent transformation.

So would you be looking for some XSLT too to do that?

All the best

Steve

It doesn't matter so much to me.

Maybe we could just move straight to real UBL. There isn't any advantage 
at the moment going to an XML 1.0 rendition.

What's different between DRRWs XML and UBL?

I believe that by adding some string filtration/translation I can do all 
the translation within a translation class.

Something like this:

 if (xpath='/Seller Information/Name') then
 UBL_xpath := '/cac:Seller Information/cac:Name';

etc..

I have a more immediate need for an XSLT transformation to handle a 
"Featured Product"

xml =

<Featured_Product>
 <img_src="skypemousephone.png">
 <name="Skype Mouse Phone">
<description>This mouse incorporates a usb skype phone</description>
</Featured_Product>

and then transform that into html text and send it out on the email list.

David

How about ebXML over open IM, David (and David)?  :-)
It's been on my mind bugging me today as it seems such
a nice fit.

I could publish perhaps a 'broadcast' pattern ebBP definition
in SystML along with Catalogue (or 'sourcing') UBL subsets
if need be.

All the best

I'm pretty sure that this has already been done somewhere. By some VC  
funded people who have a lot more cash to invest than us.

Hence I'm a bit weary.

In any case, Chinese culture is a little different than western  
culture in some senses. They prefer to deal with people that they know  
on a personal basis. Rather than through a machine.

PreisShare is a facilitator for sharing the pricing/product  
information. And being able to retrieve it from a local resident  
product database.

Asians especially want 'good price - very quick'. That's what  
preisshare is oriented towards. Waiting for a bid to come back may not  
be quick enough. But I may be wrong.

Regards

David

The sending of the data isn't the main problem.

I can tell you that you can spend an hour or two trying to convince  
somebody of the merits of a "better" messaging system.

But after two hours, they'll turn around and drop a file on Outlook  
Express and ask you "what was wrong with that?".

It's just not worth it at this point in the project.

So much so, that I'm cutting out the IM capabilities of PreisShare  
altogether for the moment. I'll reintroduce them later.

Something possibly for the future...

Hi Steve,

I've decided that we should make it as easy as possible for ourselves.

Therefore, I'm thinking that we could try distributing the 'Supplier  
product database.mdb' directly to suppliers.

Telling them to enter their product information into it.

Within access, it's pretty easy to add a few simple forms/data-entry screens.

Then what we can do is collect all the data and merge it into one  
'big' database and redistribute it.

I think this could work. We should at least give it a go for the next  
six weeks.

This will be easier than spreadsheets. I think people will get a  
better feel for the advantages of using a databased solution.

Regards

David

Hi David

That depends which xslt processor you use. Each has its own
usually simple syntax.
xalan
saxon
msxsl
...
which would you want to use?
Easy enough to check the syntax. What platforms do you need
to support?

All the best

Steve

I'll probably use msxsl for now.

Don't worry, I will build it into the code hopefully today. I was just 
wondering if there was a simple command line way of doing it. I'm using 
python and/or perl here.

The idea is that I could include this in the documentation so that users 
could debug and modify their own pages to look the way that they want.

Hi Sonmez,

I will try to dig up the xml file.

But I've just been given a link to a system that I really like. We 
really need to be doing this sort of thing with PreisShare. That is 
offering a very simple "showroom" site.

You could most definitely do this in python.

An example is:

http://www.made-in-china.com/showroom/zengzhiwen66#1

So we could then offer:

http://www.preisshare.net/showroom/zengzhiwen66#1 or something like that.

Regards

David

If separating the lines in this way is a problem then we'd need to have

<Description>
<Line>
...
</Line>
<Line>

and change the xslt accordingly

Hi David

I hope the attached is OK.

You have to be careful to separate lines in the description with
&lt;br /&gt;
otherwise the lines will all run into one another in the output
whereas with the escaped 'br' a <br /> is added to the html

All the best

Steve

Hi Stephen,

Don't worry about that so much. That was because I just cut and pasted 
it from a text editor quickly.

In the program it will get written correctly because it will go through 
msxml.

David
